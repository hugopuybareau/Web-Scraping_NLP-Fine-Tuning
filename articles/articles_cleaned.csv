The service comes nearly five months after Reddit first introduced site-wide translation for French speakers, though the company had previously enabled users to translate individual posts across several languages. Reddit already allows users to stipulate their preferred content language for post recommendations, as well as set their display language, which translates the Reddit interface itself.

Today’s announcement follows seven months after Reddit went public, and although the company has said its user base and ad revenue continue to grow, the most obvious conduit for attracting a larger base is to make all its content available in more languages.

The big selling point of Reddit’s new translation feature is that users can configure both posts and the corresponding comments to auto-translate from a community’s original language to the user’s own language according to their Reddit settings. This means that a conversation can flow in a given subreddit between two different languages, and users won’t have to manually translate every response. You can post in whatever language you want, and as long as Reddit supports it, it will automatically be translated into the community’s pre-set language.

To do this, users in supported locales will see a new translate icon in their menu that will let them view content in their preferred language.

Posts that have been translated by Reddit will be labeled as such, and users will be able to choose to view posts in the original language if they wish.

Similar to what it did with translating posts in French earlier this year, Reddit said that the content will be indexed in the supported languages for search engines, meaning people Googling for answers to questions in their own tongue will see results from Reddit, too.

Reddit doesn’t outline all the new languages it will support, but the translation service is already available in Brazil and Spain as of today, so one can assume that Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish are now supported — though presumably only in those countries.

Reddit added that it plans to expand AI-powered translations to Germany, Italy, the Philippines, and markets across Latin America “in the coming weeks.”"
1,These hyperreal drawings of trucks look just like photographs – and take up to 500 hours to make - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/style/andrew-holmes-truck-drawings-gas-tank/index.html,,"CNN —

Andrew Holmes’ images of trucks on Californian highways are sun-drenched, saturated and sharp. Looking at the crystal clear snapshots, you can almost hear the roar of the engines, feel the heat reflected off shiny aluminum gas tanks, and smell the diesel pumped out of the exhausts. But these are not photographs: each hyperreal image is in fact a color pencil drawing, resulting from between 300 and 500 hours of careful construction. Now, Holmes’ works have been brought together in a book — “Gas Tank City” (Circa Press) — alongside a show of the same name at London’s Architectural Association (AA).

Holmes trained as an architect: he attended the AA, and even worked with the late Richard Rogers in 1969, on designs for the Centre Pompidou in Paris. But Holmes has since made his name as a multimedia artist, who by his own admission has been dedicated to drawing since he was four years old. Having grown up in the English town of Bromsgrove, Holmes traveled to the US as a student, at first snapping photographs and drawing what he saw in New York City, before heading out to Los Angeles and southern California. He became entranced by the Interstate Highway System: “I discovered (it) was designed as a single object,” he explained over coffee in London. “It (was) 43,000 miles long (at the time of its original design in 1956) — the biggest object that’s ever been designed in the world.”

The artist originally trained as an architect. Andrew Holmes

In California, Holmes regularly got in his car and drove along the highways. This was the early 1970s. “In those days, driving was actually a pleasure,” he said, contrasting it to the increased traffic of more recent years. He would visit truck stops and simply observe: the gas stations, the vehicles, the roadside diners and their signs. Something about them reminded him of visiting the local train station as a child in England, and watching “these huge things belching steam” pull into the station. What he loves about trucks is a similar sensory overload: “The sound, the smell, the shiny aluminum, the size of the things.”

The 100 drawings that make up the “Gas Tank City” series seem to celebrate every inch of trucks — particularly classic Kenworth models — from their huge radiator grilles to their “West Coast” side-view mirrors, and from the sweeping curves of their fenders to their constellations of lights.

The drawings that make up the ""Gas Tank City"" book and exhibition celebrate every inch of the classic American truck, particularly the iconic Kenworth model. Andrew Holmes

The drawings are slick with color and detail. In one, a red truck carrying two gleaming gas tanks has stopped at an angle; in the reflection of the mirror-like aluminum, we see the surrounding urban landscape, including buildings across the street and a palm tree reaching into the blue sky in meticulous detail. A red sign on the truck’s side warns of flammability; green and orange tubes are strapped into place along the tanks; and every imperfection on the road or welding mark on the metal is brought into focus.

While out driving, Holmes would snap photographs on his camera of fleeting compositions that caught his eye, and then translate them into painstakingly observed drawings. While the words “hyperreal” and “photorealistic” are used to describe his work, Holmes points out that the drawings are “completely unlike” photographic images.

He remembers being frustrated with the shallow depth of field cameras had in the early 1970s: only one area would be in focus, while the rest of the image would be blurry. “I realised if you took three photographs” — identically framed but changing what was in focus — “you could then construct a drawing where everything is in focus.” Holmes’ drawings display a crisp flatness of vision that we may now be used to with smartphone cameras, but that wasn’t possible to capture on film back then.

Fifty years after he started, Holmes continues to document the vehicles of the American highway system. Andrew Holmes

Drawing also allowed him to play with light and color. “I used to draw from a 35mm (photographic) slide,” he said. “I’d hold it up against the sun, so you could see into the shadow areas.” He then drew these parts of the image as if they were artificially illuminated, bringing the colors to unreal saturation. The end result is tonally “completely different” from a photograph. When exhibited side by side, he added, the original photograph almost looks grey in comparison to the drawing.

While people aren’t the subject of “Gas Tank City,” they nevertheless infuse the series: Holmes would chat to the drivers of the trucks he drew, striking up conversations on his travels. “When I showed them a drawing, they immediately got excited and we became friends,” he said. Then the drivers helped — suggesting where else Holmes could go to see a particularly good truck stop, or collection of vehicles.

Fifty years after he started, Holmes continues to portray the highway system, its trucks and its culture. Over the decades, camera technology developed: Holmes admits to now using digital photographs as the basis for his drawings, but the works still demand hundreds of hours each. Somehow, the drawings from the early days hardly look different to those made in recent years. Together, “Gas Tank City” creates a portrait of life on the road, detached from specificities of time and place."

TL;DR MKBHD has launched a wallpaper app on iOS and Android with a premium plan that costs $12/month or $50/year.

Users have complained about the app’s performance, pricing, and permissions.

MKBHD has promised to improve the app but will likely not drop its price.

In this day and age, finding a free wallpaper for your Android phone has become exceptionally easy. Besides us supplying you with a fresh batch every Wednesday, numerous apps, websites, and AI image generators offer infinite libraries you can pick from at no charge. Nevertheless, YouTuber MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) has launched a controversial wallpaper app that costs $50 per year. Following user complaints about the app’s performance, pricing, and permissions, the YouTuber has promised to enhance the application — while maintaining the same price tag.

Earlier this week, MKBHD launched Panels — a wallpaper app for iOS and Android devices. While the app is free to download, unlocking its HD content requires a $12/month or $50/year subscription. Alternatively, users can watch two ads in a row to unlock a certain wallpaper in SD resolution.

Beyond its arguably overpriced plan, users on the web have complained about the app’s permissions and excessive ads. According to the Apple App Store listing, Panels may use its users’ location and other identifiers to track them. If permitted, the application can also track users’ activity across other apps and websites.

Following user complaints, MKBHD clarified on Twitter that the tracking permissions are mainly suggested by the ad networks and that Panels won’t actually ask users to share their location. The YouTuber has promised to fix the data collection disclosures and reduce the number of ads for free users.

As for pricing, MKBHD seemingly won’t be discounting the paid plan. Instead, he will “work to deliver that kind of value for the premium version.” Ironically, the YouTuber advertised the Panels app in his iPhone 16 review video, which criticizes Apple for delivering an unfinished product.

3,Sonic X Shadow Generations 'Sonic 3 Movie Pack' Adds Keanu Reeves - Nintendo Life,https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sonic-3-movie-pack-adds-keanu-reeves,,"@Samalik oh sorry, I didn't know characterization was the issue considering the that everyone agreed that Sonic (before Colors) was already a cool character. He was a character everyone aspired to be, the ideal, to better yourself to become a better person. But apparently, good characterization means that he has to share the insecurities of the fan base. World building? Give me a break dude, NO ONE who was into the Sonic video games ever cared about that garbage, you wanna know why? Cause that limits the potential of what you can do with a video game. By adding such a stupid restriction you ultimately make a boring lifeless world without any room for imagination. Want proof of that? Look at the last few games that came out, they reused the same aesthetics with the exact same stages over and over again. Honestly, the only people who care about that nonsense was the Adventure 2 fanbase. And that's a fact, people who liked SA2 NEVER liked the Sonic games, they only liked the terrible Archie comics with absolutely try hard storylines that's the most inorganic thing that I've ever seen to the point where it leaves everything so fragmented.

You can have serious moments, just look at the Mario and Zelda games. They have a lot of serious moments without it being so jarring that it was clearly written by an egotistical loser that the fanbase salivates for just because he makes all those awful fanfics come true. Also we've had serious storylines that still felt believable that it could take place in Sonic's world. Adventure 1 was good, Sonic Unleashed was fantastic, heck Riders and Black Knight all had great stories that were a little more serious. But for some reason, serious means ""dark"" apparently. And it means replicating Adventure 2's story, which newsflash, was never good or well written. Although I'd argue it's worse now since we have a literal fanfic writer who doesn't like the games writing for the games.

Sonic used to have integrity, he was an icon, he was someone I aspired to be. Now? He's a complete joke, no integrity, now is just a used sack for the fan base to make their insecurities that people who don't love themselves enough gravitate towards.

So excuse me, if I don't see eye to eye with this nonsense of characterization when that has NEVER been the issue with the character. Proof? Look at all the fan content from the early 2000s, everyone agreed Sonic was cool. Nowadays? He's a pathetic punching bag. And apparently, having cool characters is considered a ""bad"" thing in current era. Now everyone's gotta be ""relatable"" which funnily makes the whole thing feel extremely homogenized

And Sega doesn't seem to care anymore either. You know what I remember? When Sega initially declined Nintendo's request if they could add Sonic to Smash Bros. Nowadays, that really sticks out to me. It's almost like Sega really used to value this character. And they saw the worth in their own creation and were very proud of it. But now? Seems like they don't care anymore, they let the fanbase define what the character is, and this, Sega no longer cares about their creation. After all, it's the same company that let a bunch of idiots (including Iizuka and Kishimoto) ruin this once beloved icon."
4,OpenAI just launched advanced voice mode for audio chats with ChatGPT. Here's how to use it - CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/24/how-to-use-chatgpt-advanced-voice-mode-from-openai.html,,"ChatGPT is ready for more natural audio chats.

OpenAI said Tuesday that its popular chatbot now has an advanced voice feature for people who pay for the premium service. The tool allows for more fluid conversations.

The release will continue through the week. The company said it's not yet available in EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland or the U.K.

OpenAI announced the new capability in May. The rollout got plenty of publicity because of a voice called Sky that resembled that of Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 movie ""Her."" Legal counsel working on behalf of Johansson sent OpenAI letters claiming the company didn't have the right to use the near-identical voice, and OpenAI paused using it in its products, CNBC reported.

In the months since, people have been able to configure ChatGPT to talk to them in other voices through a free tier. The advanced version responds more quickly and will stop talking and listen if you interrupt it. There are now nine voices to choose from, and you can enter instructions for voice chats in the Customizations part of the app's settings.

""Hope you think it was worth the wait,"" Sam Altman, OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, wrote in an X post on Tuesday.

It's an increasingly competitive space for OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft .

For the past couple weeks, Google has been releasing its own Gemini Live voice feature in English on Android devices. And on Monday, Reuters reported that Meta will introduce celebrity voices later this week that can be accessed through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

OpenAI got a head start in the generative AI chatbot market, when it launched ChatGPT in late 2022. In August, OpenAI told media outlets that ChatGPT had over 200 million weekly active users.

The advanced mode is only available to those with subscriptions to OpenAI's Plus, Team or Enterprise plans. The most affordable option is the Plus tier at $20 per month."

Of course, the controls are customizable, so you can change them to suit your workflow.

“Digital creativity is undergoing a massive transformation, constantly evolving the way people create. The MX Creative Console is designed to help people redefine their workflow, enabling them to work smarter and faster,” said Anatoliy Polyanker, general manager of the MX Business Unit at Logitech.

Logitech’s MX Creative Console works with both Mac and Windows PCs and can be customized using the Logi Options+ app. The company says that more features and plugins for third-party software will be added in the future.

The new Logitech MX Creative Console is available in two different colors and can now be pre-ordered for $199. The official launch is set for October 14.

The Scarlet Forest was shown in previous trailers but this latest one gave a closer look at its lucious environments where you'll be fishing, scaling cliffs, and hunting monsters, of course. Using a hookshot-like Slinger can lead to contextual environmental destruction which can be a key part of battles.

Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered (which was first rumoured all the way back in 2022) is the work of series developer Guerrilla Games and the Sony owned Nixxes, and promises a range of enhancements for the now seven-year-old original.

As per Sony's latest State of Play broadcast, it'll include ""more than ten hours"" of rerecorded conversation motion capture, as well as ""countless"" graphical improvements said to give the remaster the same visual fidelity of Horizon Forbidden West.

Accessibility wise, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered supports many of the features introduced in Horizon Forbidden West, including remappable controls, haptic cues, and assist toggles.

Sony is also touting native support for its upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro, although it gets bit vague on the specific enhancements your £700 will get you, promsing ""improved"" graphical features and ""ultra-high fidelity at blazing fast framerates"".

As for the PC version, it'll include the PlayStation overlay with Trophy support, as well as a range of PC-exclusive features. Expect support for ultra-wide resolutions, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and AMD FSR 3.1, with more details due to be shared at a later date.

And if that grabs you, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - which includes all content seen in the Complete Edition - will cost $49.99 USD on the PlayStation Store, Steam, and Epic. Plus, there's some good news on the upgrade front, with Sony confirming existing owners of Horizon Zero Dawn or Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition (including those that acquired the game through PlayStation's Play At Home initiative) can upgrade to the new PS5 or PC version for $9.99."

On September 10th, Sony announced the $700 PS5 Pro, whose price was an immediate topic of debate — one of the most expensive PlayStations ever, even counting for inflation, and one whose disc drive is now optional and sold separately. Some joked immediately that they couldn’t even see the difference.

But though it may not have been clear from Sony’s initial YouTube livestream unveiling, we’ve since seen that the PS5 Pro does legitimately promise graphical improvements over the original PS5, particularly in games that felt compromised on the original like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

When games are explicitly patched for the new console, like the ones Sony has so far revealed, they should no longer require players to choose between a smooth 60 frames per second and a high level of detail: the PS5 Pro’s additional horsepower and AI-enhanced “PSSR” upscaling should mean you get both the high resolution and high frame rate modes of the original PS5 simultaneously.

Sony hasn’t yet revealed what resolutions or frame rates each of these enhanced games will run at internally. It has said it expects 40–50 games will have PS5 Pro patches by the time the system launches, and the PS5 Pro can still play PS4 and PS5 titles that haven’t been patched as well. Some may be able to run faster in a Boost Mode."

Due out spring 2025 on PS5 and PS4, the package will feature both Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete. The collection was announced at PlayStation State of Play, but the devs have also confirmed that it's coming to Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam, as well.

""The remastered edition brings a host of exciting upgrades, including widescreen support, enhanced pixel art, HD animated cutscenes, and all-new English voice acting,"" the devs explain on the PlayStation Blog. ""Players can choose to either go old school with the original visuals or go remastered for a more modern look. Plus, a new toggle feature allows players to speed up battles, giving them more control over the pace of their adventure, while improved strategy settings make combat even more convenient. And for the first time in the series, Lunar will be available in two additional languages: German and French, alongside English and Japanese.""

While Lunar's had numerous spin-offs and remakes over the years, The Silver Star and Eternal Blue are the two main series entries. They're both beloved classics of the JRPG format with a somewhat convoluted release history. Both titles originally launched on Sega CD, and were later remade and re-released in their ""complete"" versions on Saturn and the original PlayStation a few years later. Here's hoping this remastered collection can do them both justice when it launches next year.

Don't miss out on any of the best JRPGs out there."
12,"Walmart Quest 3S Display Reveals Resolution, Controllers, Included Batman: Arkham Shadow - UploadVR",https://www.uploadvr.com/early-quest-3s-in-store-display/,,"An early Quest 3S in-store display reveals the repeatedly leaked headset's resolution, and that it comes with controllers and Batman: Arkham Shadow.

Photos of the Quest 3S display in Walmart, seemingly put up a day early given that Meta Connect 2024 takes place tomorrow, were uploaded to the Meta Quest VR subreddit.

The photos provide yet another look at what may now be the most leaked headset in this industry's history. While the name, design, battery capacity, lack of headphone jack, new Action Button, and starting price have already leaked in the past, the details card of this Walmart store display confirms some details previously only speculatively known and reveals new ones.

The resolution listed is the exact same as Quest 2, essentially confirming previous reports that suggested Quest 3S would use the same fixed display.

The display also states that all Meta Quest 3 family headsets come with Touch Plus controllers. And while we already knew that the entry model (leaked to be $300) would come with 128GB storage, the display shows a second 256GB storage model will be available.

Arguably the most interesting reveal of the display is that the upcoming Batman: Arkham Shadow will come free ""when you buy"" Quest 3 or Quest 3S.

Previous leaks suggest Quest 3S will feature the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as Quest 3, but use the old fresnel lenses from Quest 2.

Meta is expected to officially announce Quest 3S at Meta Connect 2024 tomorrow."
13,Palworld Out Now On PS5 Days After The 'Pokémon With Guns' Survival Game Gets Sued By Nintendo - Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-nintendo-lawsuit-ps5-sony-1851656704,,"Who’s ready to capture some Pokémon-looking creatures and force them into labor camps to manufacture assault rifles? As announced in the new State of Play, PlayStation 5 players can now join in the Palworld fun with a port out on Sony’s platform just a week after maker Pocketpair was sued by Nintendo for alleged patent infringement.

English The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk

The survival crafting sim exploded in popularity on PC via Steam and Xbox Series X/S via Game Pass at the start of 2024 despite only being in Early Access. Players fight whimsical creatures and capture them to help build bases and take on tougher monsters with multiplayer raids reminiscent of what you might find in an MMO.

While the millions of concurrent players it had at launch have since moved on, Palworld continues to be a force to be reckoned with in the multiplayer live-service space, such that Nintendo decided to finally sue the Pokémon-inspired game eight months later, citing patent infringement.

“Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years,” the company wrote in a statement at the time. “At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details,” responded Pocketpair in its own statement. “It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit.”

Experts have weighed in on the dispute, suggesting that Nintendo wouldn’t bring a lawsuit against the indie developer unless it felt it had a very strong case. They cited a very specific and highly technical patent around throwing a spherical object to capture a creature that could be one of the things at issue in the lawsuit, though Nintendo hasn’t yet said what exact parts of Palworld infringe on its IP. It’s still unclear what impact that lawsuit could have on the game or its existence on rival platforms.

Update 9/25/2024 9:31 p.m. ET: Pocketpair wrote on Twitter that the game is on PS5 in the U.S. and other territories but, notably, not in Japan where the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo is underway.

14,Microsoft claims its AI safety tool not only finds errors but also fixes them - The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253452/microsoft-correction-ai-safety-tool-fix-errors,,"Microsoft is launching a new feature called “correction” that builds on the company’s efforts to combat AI inaccuracies. Customers using Microsoft Azure to power their AI systems can now use the capability to automatically detect and rewrite incorrect content in AI outputs.

The correction feature is available in preview as part of the Azure AI Studio — a suite of safety tools designed to detect vulnerabilities, find “hallucinations,” and block malicious prompts. Once enabled, the correction system will scan and identify inaccuracies in AI output by comparing it with a customer’s source material.

From there, it will highlight the mistake, provide information about why it’s incorrect, and rewrite the content in question — all “before the user is able to see” the inaccuracy. While this seems like a helpful way to address the nonsense often espoused by AI models, it might not be a fully reliable solution.

Vertex AI, Google’s cloud platform for companies developing AI systems, has a feature that “grounds” AI models by checking outputs against Google Search, a company’s own data, and (soon) third-party datasets."
15,"Google TV Streamer doesn’t come with an HDMI cable, so you’ll get a $10 discount instead - 9to5Google",http://9to5google.com/2024/09/24/google-tv-streamer-hdmi-cable/,,"One of the odd quirks of the Google TV Streamer is that the set-top box doesn’t come with an HDMI cable in the box, but Google will send you $10 off of one in its place.

The Google TV Streamer is a pretty awesome set-top box, but the $99 device lacks the HDMI cable that you’ll need to use it in the box. It’s an odd decision on Google’s part, especially seeing as Chromecast owners upgrading to the new device may quite literally not have an HDMI cable ready to replace it given that the previous dongle had that plug built in.

Google does sell a cable separately, though.

The “Google Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable” is now available through the Google Store for $19.99. The 6.5ft cable supports HDMI 2.1b and is designed specifically to complement the new Streamer. It’s just not in the box.

To make the new cable a bit more affordable for Streamer buyers, Google is sending out discount codes via email to those who have pre-ordered the device. The email reads in part:

Take $10 off a Google HDMI cable. It’s perfect for your Google TV Streamer. Because you recently pre-ordered the Google TV Streamer, we’re giving you a discount on the new Google Ultra High­-Speed HDMI Cable. Thanks for being with us since the Chromecast days.

Below that, you’ll get a unique coupon code for buying the cable at a discount.

The email implies that part of the criteria for getting this discount is having previously owned a Chromecast, which hints that Google is well aware of the potential issue that arises from not including a cable in the box.

The discount code takes the cost of the cable down to $9.99 and expires on November 30.

Of course, the Google TV Streamer readily supports any full-size HDMI cable that you might already own. However, we have noted that some cables can result in the Streamer not sitting flush on a table.

16,Report: Intel has been eliminated from PC graphics cards - PCWorld,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2467902/report-intel-has-been-eliminated-from-pc-graphics-cards.html,,"Intel may still be a dominant player in PC gaming since it sells a majority of all PC processors — and those chips have integrated graphics built into them — but as far as its presence in discrete graphics is concerned, Intel’s time has seemingly come to an end.

According to analyst firm Jon Peddie Research, shipments of PC graphics cards increased to 9.5 million units in the second quarter of 2024 (up 9 percent from the first quarter). It’s a surprising find since the 10-year average shows a 7.1 percent dip during the second quarter. JPR attributed the gain to the first-quarter launch of new cards.

The more interesting story, though, continues to be the ongoing war between AMD, Nvidia, and Intel in the discrete graphics card market. And in this war, one company has been forced out with Intel now controlling exactly zero percent of the PC graphics card market. (That drop actually occurred around the beginning of the year, reports JPR, after falling from a miniscule 2 percent a year ago.)

That makes the PC graphics card market a two-horse race. Well, barely. Nvidia holds such a commanding share of the market — 88 percent — that the company essentially controls the market outright. A year ago, Nvidia held an 80 percent share, ceding the remainder to AMD and Intel. Today, the 12 percent of the PC graphics card market that Nvidia doesn’t control has been ceded to AMD alone.

Jon Peddie Research Jon Peddie Research Jon Peddie Research

“The add-in board market continues to surprise and astonish market watchers who have been predicting its doom for decades,” said Jon Peddie, JPR’s president, in a statement. “With one little dip in Q1 (seasonally normal), we’ve seen four quarters of growth. But, overall shipments are down compared to two years ago, so that’s not encouraging. However, we remain optimistic about the future, and the fantastic games that are coming that will take all the performance an AIB can offer.”

There’s a bit of irony in all this, given that Intel just released its Lunar Lake mobile processor for laptops. Inside Lunar Lake is a new Xe2 graphics core, which Intel plans to bring to market as (potentially) a discrete GPU known as Battlemage. But Battlemage is already late, with Intel having previously predicted a 2023 debut. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s upcoming GeForce 5000 series (“Blackwell”) is eagerly awaited and hopefully will debut soon.

The good news, according to JPR analyst C. Robert Dow, is that PC graphics card prices should remain flat until Nvidia and AMD release their next-gen GPUs. Whether Intel can regain any market share at all while competing against those chips, however, seems like it would require something close to a miracle to pull off."
